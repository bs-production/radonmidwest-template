    Reliable radon company serving [major cities 1], & surrounding areas
  </h3>
  <p class="about-content">
    Radon is a naturally-occurring carcinogenic gas found in homes across the United States, with [state] being some of
    the most at-risk areas. Radon exposure is one of the leading causes of lung cancer among nonsmokers - and while the
    gas is mostly associated with basements, it can even rise to second-story rooms. Since radon is invisible and
    odorless, only reliable radon testing can help detect the hazardous gas inside a home.
  </p>

  <p class="about-content">
    But there is no reason to worry - as your trusted radon company, [company] can test your property and install a
    reliable radon mitigation system if necessary. During a radon test, one of our highly trained inspectors will go
    over the process with you, answer any questions you may have, and set up a continuous radon monitor to collect the
    most accurate data possible. If low levels of home radon are detected, you will have much-needed peace of mind that
    your home is safe. If there are high levels, our experts will work with you to install a radon mitigation system to
    efficiently reduce concentrations of the hazardous gas and keep your property protected.

    Ventilation, mold removal, air purifiers, & other indoor air quality services
  </h3>
  <p class="about-content">
    While home radon is dangerous, other indoor air pollutants can be just as much of a problem. That is why [company]
    provides reliable indoor air quality inspections looking for allergens, mold, volatile organic compounds (VOCs),
    hazardous gasses, and other contaminants. If your home has indoor air quality concerns, we offer a variety of
    solutions that we can customize to your property, including:
  </p>
  <ul class="arrows about-content">
    <li><strong>Energy recovery ventilator:</strong> An ERV replaces stale indoor air with fresh outdoor air - this also
      gives indoor air pollutants a way to escape the home.</li>
    <li><strong>Vapor intrusion mitigation:</strong> A vapor intrusion mitigation system prevents VOCs in the soil
      beneath the home from entering the property.</li>
    <li><strong>Breathe EZ Air Cleaner:</strong> The Breathe EZ Air Cleaner electronically charges air pollutants in the
      HVAC system, causing them to cling to the filter media. With carbon strips, the system also absorbs foul odors and
      hazardous chemicals.</li>
    <li><strong>Breathe EZ UVC Light:</strong> The Breathe EZ UVC Light kills mold and other bacteria that commonly
      grows inside the HVAC system.</li>
    <li><strong>Dehumidifiers:</strong> Dark, wet, and humid spaces are typical areas for mold growth. That is why we
      commonly install dehumidifiers in the basement or crawl space.</li>
  </ul>

    Did you know indoor air pollutants cause a variety of health issues? While you may not be aware of these
    contaminants, they can have a long-term impact on the well-being of you and your family. Allergens like pollen and
    pet dander can cause asthma attacks, bacteria and viruses like SARS and influenza can cause illnesses, and toxic
    gasses like radon and carbon monoxide can lead to death.
